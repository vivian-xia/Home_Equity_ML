# Home_Equity_ML

Using the Home Equity Line of Credit (HMEQ) dataset, the goal is to build and recommend a machine learning model to implement to predict the level of risk for each loan via the probability of default and the loss amount if the loan does default. The data is explored through statistical outputs and visualizations. The EDA process analyzes and transforms the data such as by converting categorial data to numerical data, address missing data and outliers. 

The experimented models include tree based models (decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting models), regression based models (logistic and linear models) based on varying variables selected from the different tree based models, and neural network models. For prediction on probability of loan default, the most accurate model is Random Forest Classifier model with the best AUC and accuracy score compared to the other models. For predicted loss amount, the recommended model is the Gradient Boosting Classifier model. It has the lowest RMSE score and uses variables that make sense in predicting loss amount.
